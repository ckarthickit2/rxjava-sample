# RxJAVA Tutorial


## What is ReactiveX 

- [ReactiveX][reactivex_intro] is a library for *"composing"* **asynchronous** and **event-based** programs using `Observable` *sequences*.
- Extends the [Observer Pattern][observer_pattern].  
  Observables fill the gap by being the ideal way to **access asynchronous sequences of multiple items**.

  |              |      single item        |    multiple items            |
  |      ---     |         ---              |        ----                 |
  | synchronous  |   `T getData()`          |   `Iterable<T> getData()`   |
  | asynchronous |   `Future<T> getData()`  |   `Observable<T> getData()` |

- [Reactive Streams][reactive_streams]  is a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking back pressure.
  
### Basic Building Blocks

- **Observables**      - Emits `data-streams`.
- **Observer** - Consumes `data-streams`
  - `Subscriber` has the methods to **unsubscribe/resubscribe** independently without the need of the observable methods.
- **Operators** - Transform `data-streams`.
 
    ![RXJava Basic Building Blocks][rxjava_basic_flow]

- **Subject** - Represents an `Observable` and `Observer` at the same time
    - allows multi-casting events from single source to multiple child.
  > A Subject is a sort of bridge or proxy that is available in some implementations of ReactiveX
  > that acts both as an observer and as an Observable.
  > Because it is an observer, it can subscribe to one or more Observables,
  > and because it is an Observable, it can pass through the items it observes by re-emitting them, and it can also emit new items.    

### Reactive Streams Counterparts

- **Publisher&lt;T&gt;** - a provider of a potentially unbounded number of sequenced elements
- **Subscriber&lt;T&gt;** - Consumes `data-streams`.
- **Processor&lt;T,R&gt;** - Represents Processing Stage which is both a `Publisher` and `Subscriber`.
- **Subscription** - represents a one-to-one lifecycle of a `Subscriber` subscribing to a `Publisher`.
  - Can only be used once by a **single Subscriber**.
  - Used to both signal desire for data and cancel demand.

### Java9 Reactive Stream Counterparts (java.util.concurrent.Flow) 

- **Flow.Publisher&lt;T&gt;** - A producer of items (and related control messages) received by Subscribers.
- **Flow.Subscriber&lt;T&gt;** - A receiver of messages.
- **Flow.Processor&lt;T,R&gt;** - A component that acts as both a Subscriber and Publisher.
- **Flow.Subscription** - Message control linking a Flow.Publisher and Flow.Subscriber.

> The interfaces available in JDK9â€™s java.util.concurrent.Flow,
> are 1:1 semantically equivalent to their respective Reactive Streams counterparts.

### RXJava Base Publishers

> Note that RxJava 3 components now live under `io.reactivex.rxjava3` and the base classes and interfaces live under `io.reactivex.rxjava3.core`.

RxJava 3 features several base classes you can discover operators on:

- [`io.reactivex.rxjava3.core.Flowable`](http://reactivex.io/RxJava/3.x/javadoc/io/reactivex/rxjava3/core/Flowable.html): 0..N flows, **supporting Reactive-Streams and backpressure**
- [`io.reactivex.rxjava3.core.Observable`](http://reactivex.io/RxJava/3.x/javadoc/io/reactivex/rxjava3/core/Observable.html): 0..N flows, **no backpressure**,
- [`io.reactivex.rxjava3.core.Single`](http://reactivex.io/RxJava/3.x/javadoc/io/reactivex/rxjava3/core/Single.html): a flow of exactly 1 item or an error,
- [`io.reactivex.rxjava3.core.Completable`](http://reactivex.io/RxJava/3.x/javadoc/io/reactivex/rxjava3/core/Completable.html): a flow without items but only a completion or error signal,
- [`io.reactivex.rxjava3.core.Maybe`](http://reactivex.io/RxJava/3.x/javadoc/io/reactivex/rxjava3/core/Maybe.html): a flow with no items, exactly one item or an error.

>To avoid name clash, the RxJava 1 `rx.Subscription` has been renamed into `io.reactivex.Disposable` in RxJava 2.

### Cold vs Hot Publishers

|         Cold Publishers                                |                         Hot Publishers                                           |
|        -----------------                               |                        -----------------                                         |
| They only begin emitting when  there is a subscriber   |   They begins generating items and emits them immediately when they are created  |
| All subscribers receive the exact set of historical data, regardless of when they subscribe |       Reception of data depends on the type of Publisher (Eg.,`Subject`) used |
| The subscriber is taking elements only when it is ready to process that item (**in a pull fashion**) | They emits items at its own pace, and it is up to its subscriber to keep up. (**push fashion**)|
| Items do not need to be buffered in a publisher because they are requested in pull fashion | If subscriber is not able to consume items as quickly as they are produced by a publisher, they need to be buffered or handled in some other way, as they will fill up the memory, finally causing OutOfMemoryException |
| **data-driven** is cold                                | **event-driven** is hot                                                            |
| **Flowable** and **Observable** are generally cold     | **Subjects** are one way to handle hot observables                               |
